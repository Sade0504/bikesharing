The purpose of this analysis was to create a bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, similiar to one located in New York City. In order to receive funding for this project we have to convience investors that this program is worthwhile. This Tableau analysis will help us answer a few questions like:
- Who uses bikeshare progams?
- What is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and least?
